## Description

This library provides functions to encode and decode *Numbers* into a 64 bit unsigned integer.

This document use the word "*Number*" to indicate any of the following:

* **DID** (*Direct Inward Dial*)  : [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) Telephone Number
* **LVN** (*Long Virtual Number*) : Another definition of DID
* **VLN** (*Virtual Long Number*) : Another definition of DID
* **SC**  (*Short Code*)          : Short number usually containing 4-8 digits

Short Codes (SC) numbers are not universally unique and requires the addition of the country prefix to be uniquely identified.
In other words, the same SC can be used in different countries.

Long numbers do not require a country code to be uniquely identified as the country information is already encoded in the number.
The ITU-T recommendation [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) establish max 15 digits for a number.

## Encoding

Modern computers and operating systems are optimized to manipulate 64 bit words, so they are extremely more efficient than using arbitrary strings.

The individual components of a number identifier (country + number) can be easily encoded in 64 bit unsigned integer.

Numbers can be encoded in a reversible way, so we can instantly map a *Number* to a *NumKey* and a *NumKey* to a *Number* without the need of a lookup table.

The encoding is as below:

* 5 + 5 bit to represent each letter of the ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code.
	* Uppercase ASCII characters are transleted back by 64dec, so 1=A and 26=Z.
* 50 bit to encode the number.
* 4 bit to indicate the total number or digits in the number (max 2^4 =16)



The NumKey is composed of 3 sections arranged in 64 bit:


```
           0   4 5                                                            59 60 63
           |   | |                                                             | |  |
           01234 567 89012345 67890123 45678901 2 3456789 01234567 89012345 6789 0123
5 bit COUNTRY >| |<                       50 bit NUMBER                       >| |< 4 bit LENGHT
```

Example of NumKey encoding:

```
               | COUNTRY    | NUMBER                                          | LEN |

### Properties

* Each NumKey code is unique for a given Number.
* It can be quickly encoded and decoded on-the-fly.
* Sorting by NumKey is equivalent of sorting by country and number.
* The 64 bit NumKey can be exported as a 16 character hexadecimal string.
* Sorting the hexadecimal representation of NumKey in alphabetical order is equivalent of sorting the NumKey numerically.
* Comparing two Numbers by NumKey only requires comparing two 64 bit numbers, a very well optimized operation in current computer architectures.
* NumKey can be used as a main database key to index data by "Number". This simplify common searching, merging and filtering operations.
* All types of database joins between two data sets (inner, left, right and full) can be easily performed using the NumKey as index.
* Less data storage, less memory usage and increased performances.
* Enable the usage ok key-value systems.
* Enable the use of columnar data formats like *Apache Arrow* with the ability to perform fast binary searches.

<a name="quickstart"></a>
## Quick Start

This project includes a Makefile that allows you to test and build the project in a Linux-compatible system with simple commands.

To see all available options, from the project root type:

```
make help
```

To build all the NumKey versions inside a Docker container (requires Docker):

```
make dbuild
```

An arbitrary make target can be executed inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container by specifying the `MAKETARGET` parameter:

```
MAKETARGET='build' make dbuild
```
The list of make targets can be obtained by typing ```make```


The base Docker building environment is defined in the following Dockerfile:

```
resources/Docker/Dockerfile.dev
```

To build and test only a specific language version, `cd` into the language directory and use the `make` command.
For example:

```
cd c
make test
```
